# GreenMine: Real-Time ESG-Aware Trading Dashboard

GreenMine is a real-time reinforcement learning (RL) dashboard developed for the MARA Hackathon 2025. It optimizes the allocation of compute resources (e.g., ASICs, GPUs, immersion miners) to maximize financial profit while minimizing environmental impact ‚Äî specifically CO‚ÇÇ emissions, water consumption, and electronic waste (e-waste).

This system integrates a custom RL environment, live market data, real-time ESG signals, and a Streamlit-based dashboard for tuning and visualization.

## üåç Key Features

- ‚úÖ Real-time resource allocation via PPO agent.
- üìâ Live visualization of market trends, emissions, and optimization scores.
- üîÅ Dynamic adjustment of reward weights (profit, CO‚ÇÇ, water, e-waste).
- ‚öôÔ∏è Modular Gym environment with realistic constraints.
- üß† Strategy comparison between reinforcement learning and baseline heuristics.
- üîÑ 30-second auto-refresh with current price and ESG signals.
